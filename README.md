# Quiz App

This app uses the GitHub Quiz API to get questions based on the user selected difficulty. The user can then answer the questions and the app will track their correct and incorrect scores. The scores can be cleared at any time.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-quiz-app.git
cd github-quiz-app
npm install
​
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app by typing the following command in the terminal:

```
npm start
​```

The app will be served on port 3000. You can access it by opening the following URL in your browser: http://localhost:3000


​
## Usage

The app is very simple to use. To start a quiz, click on the "Start Quiz" button. You will then be asked to select a difficulty level. Once you have selected a difficulty level, you will be presented with a series of questions.

To answer a question, click on one of the answer choices. If you answer the question correctly, your score will increase. If you answer the question incorrectly, your score will decrease.

When you have finished answering all of the questions, you will be shown your final score. You can then click on the "Clear Scores" button to clear your scores and start a new quiz.
